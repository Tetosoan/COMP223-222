Final project
Snake Game
This is a classic snake game where players need to control a snake to move around the screen, eat food and avoid hitting walls or their own body. The game is mainly developed using Python language.

motivation:
My main motivation for creating this Snake game is to show beginners how to use the Python language to develop a simple and fun game. This game helps beginners understand basic game development concepts such as game loops, graphics drawing, and user input handling.

Why did our create this project?
I hope this project can be a starting point for beginners to learn Python game development. Through this game, they can learn how to handle game logic, collision detection, game state management, and more. I believe that by actually developing a simple game, beginners can better understand and apply what they have learned.

What did you learn through your project experience?
Through this project, I learned how to use Python language for game development. I became familiar with the concept of game loops and learned to handle common game development tasks such as user input, graphics drawing, collision detection, etc. Additionally, I solidified my programming skills and learned how to organize code, manage projects, and debug.

What makes your project stand out?
What makes this Snake game stand out is its simplicity and ease of understanding. It uses concise code to implement basic game logic, suitable for beginners to learn and modify. Additionally, the documentation and comments for this project are very clear, making it easy for beginners to understand and follow.

If my project has other features, I can add a "Features" section to list them. However, since this is a simple Snake game, there are no other special features to list at the moment.
